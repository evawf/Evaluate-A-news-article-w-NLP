# News Article Evaluation Project

This is my fourth project from Udacity FrontEndWebDeveloper Course, through this project to learn how to use Webpack to bundle html, css and js files, and add necessary loaders & plugins.

I've followed the course to practice with:
- Setting up Webpack
- Sass styles
- Webpack Loaders and Plugins
- Creating layouts and page design
- Service workers
- Using APIs and creating requests to external urls

I used Meaning Cloud Sentiment Analysis API to perform sentiment analysis of news artical(url). It identifies the positive, 
negative, neutral polarity in any text, including comments in surveys and social media. It also extracts sentiment at the 
document or aspect-based level. In order to do this, the local polarity of the different sentences in the text is identified 
and the relationship between them evaluated, resulting in a global polarity value for the whole text. More details please 
check [here](https://www.meaningcloud.com/developer/sentiment-analysis).

## Coding Steps
I used the starter code for this project, then followed the project instructions: 
- Install and configure Webpack
